# student_accommodation 
This is a database application with the following background:
The present scope of the project encompasses students who seek temporary accommodation before
moving into a permanent one. This eliminates the need of booking hotel rooms. More importantly,
people find themselves in a friendly and home-like atmosphere. In such cases, like-minded people
can help the visitors cope with the needs of food habits, language and similar preferences. Cost is
also an important factor in situations like this. Staying at a hotel proves to be more expensive.
Instead, one can choose to be with people who are ready to help and who pursue similar interests. 

Current students can add available accommodation
Propective students can book & cancel these temporary accommodations
Property managers can also make their properties available to be viewed by new students
